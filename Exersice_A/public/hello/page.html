        <p>In the film, Marvin is a short, stout robot built of smooth, white plastic. His arms are much longer than his legs, and his head is a massive sphere with only a pair of triangle eyes for a face. His large head and simian-like proportions give Marvin a perpetual slouch, adding to his melancholy personality.</p>
        <p>At the start of the film his eyes glow, but at the end he is shot but unharmed, leaving a hole in his head and dimming his eyes.</p>
